Onnozone is the creative makerspace of Onno Heesbeen.

This year I have been active for 20 years in the field of maritime photography, illustration, conceptual design and modeling.
To celebrate this, the website is undergoing a transformation into an online magazine, so that sharing projects, new articles and content becomes a lot easier.

Currently my activities can be followed at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Onnozone-113172183839158){:target="_blank"} and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIe_v09FFodVGK34RnATljA){:target="_blank"}
