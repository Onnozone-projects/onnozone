Sharpening the details.

<!--more-->

This is as sharp as I can get with this material. With a layer of primer it will look super smooth.

I'm considering making a mold and casting at least one copy that I can paint and "abuse". I have been experimenting with silicone molding, though I'm a bit scared to use the sculpture as a master but it will be fun to create resin copies and offer a limited edition “garage” kit.
