This year (to be more precise next month) will mark the 20th anniversary of me starting maritime photography.

I could not let this occasion slip by unnoticed and to celebrate with everyone I'm releasing a high quality black and white photo book with a personal selection of my favorite photos and ships I made over the years.

I have already made a nice test print and am finetuning my final selection.

The book will have 24 pages 16/21cm and will cost 45Euro (shipping costs excluded). If you would like a signed copy you can already place order by FB massage. I will keep you informed about the progress. Feel free to share the message!
