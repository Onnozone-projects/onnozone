Small mechanical details.

<!--more-->

Carving by hand was perfect to create the head shape, however the more smaller and mechanical details need a different approach. I build them in 3D modeling program so I can 3D print them.

While the 3D printer is busy I filled up some uneven parts on the skin of the head. The next day when the parts were printed I did a dry test on the head to see if they fitted or needed some alteration.
