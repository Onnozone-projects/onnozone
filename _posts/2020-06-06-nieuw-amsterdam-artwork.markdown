A worthy ship for an epic limited edition illustration.

I’m happy to reveal my Nieuw Amsterdam II funnel art, a worthy ship for an epic limited edition illustration.

As with all my projects it started out as a hand drawn sketch to study what angle and composition would fit best for the final artwork. although the original ship’s second funnel would never belge smoke, I felt I could use some artistic license to make the final artwork a bit more dramatic.
