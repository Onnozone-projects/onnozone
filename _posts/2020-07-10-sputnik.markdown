Photo shoot of scratch build model.

<!--more-->

A project that has been on my "to do" list for a while.

It is roughly 1/4th scale, but with the antennas attached it still takes up a large volume.

The sensor bays and antenna attachments I have 3D modeled for 3D printing. The rest of the model is scratch build.
