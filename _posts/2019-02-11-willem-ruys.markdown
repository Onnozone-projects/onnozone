My personal record in building a ship model.

<!--more-->
I started the model exactly on the 1st of January, 42 days must be my personal record in building a ship model.

The large scale 1:200 was also a new for me and I learned a lot of new skills and techniques.

I set out to make “study” model (inspired by an original water tank test model of the Oranje at the Amsterdam maritime museum)

That meant it had to look sterile and to the point, not too much pointless details that would distract.

I’m slowly planning another 1:200 build in this same style, but all will be revealed in good time.
