Neck of the droid.

<!--more-->

Overnight I printed out the neck of the droid.

I made it hollow so I can eventually rotate the head on the neck for different poses.

Also found an extra piece of scrap foam that Iâ€™m carving into a partial torso to make a nicer overall presentation. It's actually fun extending the head model.
