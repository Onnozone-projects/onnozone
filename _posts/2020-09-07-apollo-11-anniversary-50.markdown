50 years ago the moon was the site of an amazing event.

The moon landing and space travel captured my imagination as a kid and it is a continuous source of inspiration. On the exact day that Neil Armstrong stepped of the lunar lander 50 years ago and said his famous words.

I stayed up during the night to capture these photo's and film.

I hope you will enjoy this compilation I made and feel free to share the clip.
