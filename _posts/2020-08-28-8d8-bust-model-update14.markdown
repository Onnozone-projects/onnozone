First resin cast.

<!--more-->

"And then there are two!"

First resin cast is not at all perfect but a good learning experiment. I need to get a feeling how much to rotate the mold to get an evenly thick wall. But overall I'm impressed with the details, even surface texture details where copied.

I'm confident that after some more tests I can make perfect copies.
