The start of my next model project.

<!--more-->

Drawing up the start of my next model project.
8D8 the torture droid from Return of the Jedi, this depressed looking droid in Jabba's torture dungeon always fascinated me.

I made some good reference pictures at Star Wars Identities a couple years ago, already having this idea to model that head.

I'm ready to experiment with other modeling techniques, so I got a block of Styrofoam and will carve it directly out of it. It will be a fun build and Iâ€™m ready to get dirty!
