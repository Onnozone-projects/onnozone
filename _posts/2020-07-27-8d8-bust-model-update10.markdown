Taking it to the next level.

<!--more-->

Now that the plan has changed and I will be producing a limited batch of "garage kits" I have been tweaking the "master" model to have the option of installing LEDs into the eyes and holes you can cut for the wires.

I made alignment pegs to position the eyes correctly (which unintentionally gave the robot head a cute expression) The eye pieces will eventually be cast in clear plexiglas and can hold a small LED.

The head itself will be from resin. I'm super excited to produce my very first kit, so much to learn here.
